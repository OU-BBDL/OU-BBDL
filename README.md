This is the official repository of the Biomechanics and Biomaterials Design Laboratory (BBDL) at the University of Oklahoma (OU). 

This serves as the central location for all processing scripts and software developments within the BBDL.

Examples include:
-Tissue test post-processing
-Optimization
-pSFDI processing

Our MATLAB scripts serve as the "old" backup of our processing, but we are slowly transitioning to Python for an open source, free alternative. We recommend using Pycharm as your Python compiler/editor, but any editor is fine really.

As of now, this respository is managed by Colton, so reach out to him if you have any questions or issues.
